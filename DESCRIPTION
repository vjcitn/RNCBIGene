Description: This package is based on transforming key textual resources from NCBI Gene to
	parquet.  Resources from May 2025 were made available in an NSF Open Storage Network
	bucket.  This package illustrates the use of standard and tidyverse-oriented approaches
	to querying and using annotation on genes for all organisms covered by NCBI Gene.
